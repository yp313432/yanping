/**
* Cross-bundle `instanceof` support for the SDK error classes.
*
* `@modelcontextprotocol/client` and `@modelcontextprotocol/server` each bundle their
* own copy of `core-internal`, so an error constructed by one package fails a
* prototype-identity `instanceof` against the same class re-exported by the other —
* exactly the check a dual-role process (gateway, host, in-process test) writes.
*
* Instead of prototype identity, branded classes stamp every instance with the brand
* strings of its class chain under a registry symbol (`Symbol.for`, shared across
* bundles and realms), and resolve `instanceof` via `Symbol.hasInstance` against the
* brand set. Ordinary prototype-based `instanceof` is kept as a fallback so behavior
* is unchanged for anything unbranded.
*
* A class participates by defining an **own** `mcpBrand` static (via a `static {}`
* block, so nothing reaches the declaration files — a declared `protected static`
* field would make the constructor types nominally incompatible across the bundled
* copies) and (for hierarchy roots) installing {@linkcode brandedHasInstance} as
* `Symbol.hasInstance`. User-defined subclasses that do not declare their own brand
* keep plain prototype semantics — a foreign base-class instance never satisfies
* `instanceof UserSubclass`.
*
* Prior art — the same stamp-and-hook shape ships at scale elsewhere: Node core
* (stream.Writable since 2017, Console via a marker symbol, diagnostics_channel),
* undici's whole error hierarchy (vendored into Node as fetch), googleapis/gaxios
* (GaxiosError, Symbol.for marker), AWS SDK v3's ServiceException (which pairs a
* Symbol.hasInstance override with a static isInstance guard, as we do), and zod v4
* (Symbol.hasInstance on every schema class for cross-version interop).
*
* Contract notes:
* - Participation criterion: **every error class exported from a public package that
*   callers are documented to `instanceof` must be branded.** The per-package
*   errorBrandConformance tests walk the export surfaces and fail naming any
*   exported Error subclass that has not opted in.
* - Brands assert **identity, not shape**: brand strings are version-less, so an
*   instance from one SDK version matches the class of another. Members added to a
*   branded class in a later version may be absent on a matched instance — read
*   fields defensively, and treat branded classes as additive-only. The escape
*   hatch when a release must break a branded class's read contract: change that
*   class's brand string in the same release, which cleanly severs cross-version
*   matching for that class. The per-package brand pins make the rename
*   deliberate: errorSurfacePins.test.ts owns the core-internal brands, and each
*   package's errorBrandConformance test pins its package-local ones.
* - Cross-bundle matching requires **both** copies to be at or after the release
*   that introduced branding; against an older copy, behavior degrades to plain
*   prototype `instanceof` in both directions.
* - A consumer re-bundling the SDK with property mangling (`mangle.props`) would
*   break the brand statics; default esbuild/webpack/terser settings do not.

* 2026-era wire schemas (protocol revision 2026-07-28).
*
* Fully self-contained — no runtime imports from types/schemas.ts. The
* neutral types/schemas.ts layer is the public-API superset and is free to
* evolve; this file is the 2026 wire-parse contract and is BEHAVIOR-FROZEN
* against the 2026-07-28 anchor. Every era-shared building block (content
* blocks, resources, prompts, capabilities, notifications, …) that the wire
* shapes compose is a frozen LOCAL copy — verbatim from the neutral layer at
* the point this revision was sealed, dependencies first. The only cross-layer
* dependency is `import type { JSONObject, JSONValue }` from the neutral types
* barrel — pure structural type aliases with no parse behavior.
*
* This module is the only place the per-request `_meta` envelope is modeled.
* The envelope is wire-only vocabulary: the protocol layer lifts it off
* inbound requests before any handler runs and surfaces it at
* `ctx.mcpReq.envelope`; the 2026-era codec enforces its requiredness at
* dispatch time (`checkInboundEnvelope`) - the former neutral-schema JSDoc
* deferral ("enforced per request at dispatch time, not here") is now
* discharged by that codec step.
*
* No 2025-era traffic ever touches this module, so requiredness here is
* bare and spec-exact (the shared-schema `.catch` hazards do not apply).
*
* SPEC-CURRENCY RE-SEAL (2026-07-17): the 2026-07-28 revision was re-sealed
* upstream by spec PR #3002 (commit 71e30695, merged 2026-07-15 — after the
* previous anchor pin f68d864a): the envelope's `clientInfo` demoted from
* required to SHOULD, and `DiscoverResult.serverInfo` moved from the result
* body to the new `ResultMetaObject` key
* `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/serverInfo']` (optional on every result).
* The shapes below are the re-sealed anchor, exactly — no pre-#3002 shape is
* modeled anywhere (per ruling: the final revision is the only 2026-07-28).

/**
* Inbound HTTP request classification and the inbound validation ladder
* (protocol revision 2026-07-28).
*
* `classifyInboundRequest` is the body-primary era predicate for an HTTP
* entry that serves both protocol eras on one endpoint. It is evaluated
* exactly once, at the entry boundary, on the already-parsed request body:
*
* - `initialize` is a legacy-era request by definition (the modern era has no
*   `initialize` handshake) — unless it carries a valid envelope claim naming
*   a modern revision, in which case the claim wins and the request is
*   classified like any other enveloped request (the modern era then answers
*   it with method-not-found, exactly like every other method it does not
*   define).
* - A request whose `params._meta` carries the reserved protocol-version key
*   claims the per-request envelope mechanism and classifies into the era the
*   named revision belongs to (a malformed envelope behind a present claim is
*   a validation error, never a silent fall back to legacy handling).
* - A request without a claim is legacy-era traffic.
* - The `MCP-Protocol-Version` header is a cross-check only: it never
*   upgrades or downgrades a body-derived classification, and a disagreement
*   between header and body is an explicit ladder outcome.
* - Notifications carry no envelope claim of their own under the current
*   spec, so for notification POSTs without a body claim the modern header is
*   determinative; the `Mcp-Method` header is validated against the body when
*   the message classifies modern and is never enforced on legacy traffic.
*   A notification that does carry a claim is treated body-primary like a
*   request, and a malformed claim is rejected the same way a request's
*   malformed claim is — never silently resolved against the header.
*   The notification-POST header cross-checks here are an SDK-defensive
*   posture, not a spec requirement: the spec leaves header rules for posted
*   notifications undefined (core client notifications do not occur over
*   Streamable HTTP); applying the request rules symmetrically is what an
*   ecosystem custom-notification POST expects, and the −32020 cells stay
*   passing for them.
* - `GET`/`DELETE` (and any other non-`POST` method) are body-less 2025-era
*   session operations: the modern era is `POST`-only, so they are routed to
*   legacy serving when it is configured and rejected otherwise.
* - Array (batch) bodies are classified element-wise: an array containing a
*   modern-claiming or invalid element is rejected, an all-legacy array is
*   legacy traffic unchanged, and a single-element array is still an array.
*
* The classifier returns plain values (it never throws and never touches a
* transport): a routing outcome (`legacy`/`modern`) or a ladder rejection
* carrying the JSON-RPC error to emit and the HTTP status to emit it with.
* Legacy routing outcomes deliberately carry NO `MessageClassification` —
* legacy and hand-wired traffic is never classified, which keeps its
* dispatch behavior byte-identical to today's.
*
* Error codes for the modern-path rejection cells follow the published
* conformance suite (and the spec text it asserts):
*
* - A header/body cross-check mismatch (the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header
*   disagreeing with the body, or the `Mcp-Method` header disagreeing with the
*   body method) is rejected with `-32020` (`HeaderMismatch`) on HTTP 400.
* - A request whose protocol-version header names a modern revision but whose
*   body carries no `_meta` envelope claim — including an envelope present but
*   missing the required protocol-version key — is rejected with `-32602`
*   (invalid params) naming the missing key(s), on HTTP 400.
*
* Should a future spec revision or conformance release change these
* assignments, the affected cells are re-derived against that release; the
* `settled` flag on {@linkcode InboundLadderRejection} stays available to mark
* a cell provisional again while such a change is in flight.

*
* In stateful mode:
* - Session ID is generated and included in response headers
* - Session ID is always included in initialization responses
* - Requests with invalid session IDs are rejected with `404 Not Found`
* - Non-initialization requests without a session ID are rejected with `400 Bad Request`
* - State is maintained in-memory (connections, message history)
*
* In stateless mode:
* - No Session ID is included in any responses
* - No session validation is performed
*
* @example Stateful setup
* ```ts source="./streamableHttp.examples.ts#WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport_stateful"
* const server = new McpServer({ name: 'my-server', version: '1.0.0' });
*
* const transport = new WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport({

* ```ts source="./streamableHttp.examples.ts#WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport_stateless"
* const transport = new WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport({

* modern-only strict endpoint.
*
* Mounting: `handler.fetch` is the web-standard face (Cloudflare Workers,
* Deno, Bun, Hono's `c.req.raw`); for Express/Fastify/plain `node:http`, wrap
* the handler once with `toNodeHandler(handler)` from
* `@modelcontextprotocol/node`. When mounting bare on a fetch-native runtime,
* put Origin/Host validation in front of the handler — the entry itself is
* deliberately validation-free:
*
* ```ts
* import { hostHeaderValidationResponse, originValidationResponse, localhostAllowedHostnames, localhostAllowedOrigins } from '@modelcontextprotocol/server';
*
* export default {
*     async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
*         const rejected =
*             hostHeaderValidationResponse(request, localhostAllowedHostnames()) ??
*             originValidationResponse(request, localhostAllowedOrigins());
*         return rejected ?? handler.fetch(request);
*     }
* };
* ```
*
* Use ONE factory for both legs: the same tools/resources/prompts definition
* backs the modern path and the stateless legacy fallback, so the two eras can
* never drift apart. To keep an existing legacy deployment (for example a
* sessionful streamable HTTP wiring) serving 2025 traffic instead of the
* stateless fallback, route in user land with {@linkcode isLegacyRequest} in
* front of a strict handler — see that predicate's documentation for the
* pattern. Power users composing transport-neutral routing can also use the
* exported building blocks directly: {@linkcode classifyInboundRequest} for
* the era decision and `PerRequestHTTPServerTransport` for single-exchange
* serving — such compositions must reject POSTs whose Content-Type media type
* is not `application/json` (415) before parsing the body, using
* {@linkcode isJsonContentType}; neither building block performs this
* validation itself.
*
* The entry performs no token verification: `authInfo` given to `fetch` is
* passed through to handlers and the factory as-is and is never derived from
* request headers.
